    <string name="test_description">In today\'s world, there are hundreds, if not thousands of
        different programming languages. Each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages,
        which are not always obvious. That\'s why for a person who wants to become a developer,
        it is super difficult or even impossible to decide which language to choose.\n\nTo solve
        this problem, I made a short interactive test, which will help to determine, which
        programming language is the best for you ‚ò∫\n\nJust tell me your name and we can begin!</string>
